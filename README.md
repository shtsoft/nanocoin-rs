A reimplementation of [nanocoin](https://github.com/bkolad/nanocoin) in **Rust** to **learn**.

- learn:
  * udp-based network programming
  * the hype about blockchains
- Rust:
  * safety:
    + thoroughly testet
    + memory-safety: no `unsafe`-code
  * is more real-world than Haskell ;)

For documentation see [Released API docs](https://docs.rs/nanocoin-rs).
In particular, you can find a design- and usage-description there.
